# Hadean
Hadean is an idea for a hobby project game where the user goes through the history of Earth starting 4.5 billion years ago. The user can play with its elements and lifeforms to affect its future and move through time. 

This game will draw inspiration from Godfinger, Spore and EarthSim. 

The user will first take control of a young Earth and later take control of the organisms and the extinctions that occur. 

I want this project to run in the browser and hopefully even be user friendly enough to work on mobile.
